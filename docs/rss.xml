Well I just an undergraduate student who has just switched from civil engineering to computer science. I hope to document my gradual growth process! I wish to keep writing daily summaries, continuously reflect on myself, and keep making progress!&#13;
&#13;
And right now it is 2024.09.16 I am in my junior year and literally I only know a little about python and c++ and some other basic theoretical course knowledge (will be forgotten in the short term for sure haha)&#13;
&#13;
And I don't know where I'm going to improve in the next two years so here will be my study diary ~&#13;
### Future Plan 💪💪&#13;
following years plan maybe &#13;
1. take cs degree courses; &#13;
2. figure out what academic topics I like and improve my coding skills accordingly; &#13;
3. have a satisfying summer research internship&#13;
4. I do wish have some academic publications (I know it is a wishful thinking but just a goal)&#13;
5. successfully applied for a Ph.D. degree 2026fall;。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://oneHFR.github.io/xiaoxiaowu.github.io/post/Original%20purpose%20for%20this%20blog%20web.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 12:26:43 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
