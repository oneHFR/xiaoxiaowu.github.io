### BG 🤗🐑
Well I just an undergraduate student who has just switched from civil engineering to computer science. I hope to document my gradual growth process! I wish to keep writing daily summaries, continuously reflect on myself, and keep making progress!

And right now it is 2024.09.16 I am in my junior year and literally I only know a little about python and c++ and some other basic theoretical course knowledge (will be forgotten in the short term for sure haha)

And I don't know where I'm going to improve in the next two years so here will be my study diary ~
### Future Plan 💪💪
following years plan maybe 
1. take cs degree courses; 
2. figure out what academic topics I like and improve my coding skills accordingly; 
3. have a satisfying summer research internship
4. I do wish have some academic publications (I know it is a wishful thinking but just a goal)
5. successfully applied for a Ph.D. degree 2026fall;
